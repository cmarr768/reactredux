This is meant to be a shell app for a react+redux app.  I started with the reactshell codebase.

mkdir reactredux
npm init
follow reactshell installs

    npm install redux react-redux --save

I pulled this together from my react redux app and used the concepts
from the redux tutorial found http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/ExampleTodoList.html and from this https://github.com/happypoulp/redux-tutorial.
